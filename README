The app is still under development. The ideas are based on Ryan Carson's article about metrics over at Think Vitamin.

In short:

1) Create a campaign. This is an advertising campaign;
2) For the links to your site on that advertising campaign, append a query string e.g. ?cid=;
3) The before_filter in application_controller.rb will record the visit and set a cookie;
4) When a visitor signs up, if they have a cookie, you can record it as a signup via that campaign.

The app calculates some basic metrics on those signups.

The file user_create.rb will create random entries in your db to illustrate the metrics in development.
